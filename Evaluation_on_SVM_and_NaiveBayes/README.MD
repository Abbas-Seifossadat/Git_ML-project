This notebook aims to evaluate SVM and Naive Bayes models on a Multiclass Classification task. 


To this end, I generated a dataset with 10,000 records and 50 features. 


In the first step, SVM and NB are trained. 


Then, the dataset is manipulated by randomly removing 30% of instances. 


In the next step, these two models are trained by considering two approaches (mean values and KNN) for re-filling Null values and the results will be compared.
